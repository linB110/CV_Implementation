This folder follows the structure of [ORB\_SLAM2](https://github.com/raulmur/ORB_SLAM2) and [DBoW2](https://github.com/dorian3d/DBoW2)

It includes a BoW (Bag of Words) training program that allows you to generate a custom vocabulary compatible with the ORB-SLAM2 system.
You can use the trained vocabulary by simply replacing the original vocabulary fileâ€”no other modifications to ORB-SLAM2 are required.
